# lod2.zip

Contains the Go application powering [lod2.zip](https://lod2.zip/).

## Setup

Required files in the config directory (defaults to `~/.config/lod2/`):

- `keys/auth/private.jwk.json`: the private JWK used for signing authentication JWTs. Create this at [mkjwk.org](https://mkjwk.org/); choose Key Use: Signature, Algorithm: RS256, then click Generate. Use the "Public and Private Keypair" JSON object as the contents of this file.

## Usage

```sh
go run main.go
```

## Principles

- **Graceful degradation.** The server is self-reliant in that (at the moment) it is responsible for handling GitHub push webhooks to trigger a rebuild. If the server hard crashes, it will need manual SSH intervention to restart.
- **Self-sufficient.** Minimal external depenendencies reduce the chance of unexpected, uncontrolled issues and improve reliability.
